# Twotter!

Twotter is a basic Twitter clone that I created following [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-javascript-final-project) curriculum for the final project in the JavaScript path!

### Summary

The goal of this project was to replicate a website people use everyday. While I am satisfied with how this initial version turned out, I know there is a lot more I could do to make it better. For now this is where I'm leaving it for this version. Eventually I might come back to this project to implement some more cool features.

### Languages/Tools

This project utilizes React on the frontend and Firebase as the backend.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React Library/Firebase

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
