# Twotter!

Twotter is a basic Twitter clone that I created following [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-javascript-final-project) curriculum for the final project in the JavaScript path!

### Summary

The goal of this project was to build a full stack application of a website people use everyday, so I decided to use Twitter as a template. Rather than using routes to determine component renders, I decided to try and make it a singlepage application to solidify knowledge with state and effect hooks.

### Languages/Tools

This project utilizes React on the frontend and Firebase as the backend.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React/Firebase

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
